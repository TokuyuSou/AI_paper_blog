    "background": "Before this work, most time-series benchmarks either came from very different domains (like traffic or air quality) or shown only simple, standalone signals. They didn’t give you a real picture of a living software system: lots of services talking to each other, each producing many metrics at once, and the way one service affects another through a web of dependencies. In short, researchers often had to study time series in a simplified world, which makes it hard to test forecasting methods that should work in real, complex software environments.\n\nAnother gap was the absence of real-world incident information paired with the data. In production systems, things break, slow down, or behave oddly during outages, and those moments matter a lot for both forecasting and anomaly detection. Without labeled incident windows that align with actual events, it’s tough to evaluate whether a model can still forecast well when problems happen or whether an anomaly detector would notice something dangerous in time. This kind of realism was hard to obtain and hard to compare across studies.\n\nWhy a graph-structured, incident-labeled dataset matters is that modern microservices are not just many separate time series—they form a network where services influence each other. Forecasting accuracy can depend on understanding those connections, because a problem in one service can cascade to others. ChronoGraph gives researchers a realistic playground that (a) shows multivariate signals from many services, (b) encodes the explicit dependency graph, and (c) includes real incident annotations. This setup lets scientists study how to do structure-aware forecasting and how to evaluate forecasts and detectors under real operational disruptions, bringing research closer to what engineers actually face in production.",
    "methodology": "ChronoGraph is a dataset that blends time, systems, and structure to study how things change in a real software environment. Imagine a network of microservices as a city map: each service is a location (a node) that constantly emits several signals like CPU usage, memory, and network traffic (the multivariate time series), and the arrows between nodes reflect which services depend on others. The goal is to forecast how these signals will look in the near future for every service, while also providing real incident labels so we can test how well anomaly detectors work and how forecast accuracy holds up during disruptions.\n\nHere’s how the main approach unfolds, in simple steps:\n- Collect signals: Each service continuously emits multiple metrics over time, creating a rich multivariate stream per node.\n- Map the dependencies: The directed edges encode how services influence each other, forming a real, machine-readable graph.\n- Define the forecasting task: Use the historical signals, plus the graph structure, to predict future metric values for each service.\n- Add anomaly labels: Expert-annotated incident windows mark when disruptions occurred, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection and robustness of forecasts during outages.\n- Benchmark a range of methods: Test traditional forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors to see how well they handle both the temporal data and the graph structure.\n\nConceptually, the key ideas are intuitive. The graph helps forecasting by letting information flow along real dependencies: if one upstream service suddenly uses more CPU or memory, downstream services often react shortly after, and the graph provides a natural way for a model to share this signals across related services. The anomaly labels give researchers a concrete way to probe how forecasts behave when incidents happen, not just under normal conditions. By combining multivariate time series, a clear dependency graph, and real incident annotations, ChronoGraph offers a realistic playground for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in a live microservice setting.\n\nIn practice, this dataset enables experiments like: training models that explicitly use the network of services to improve future predictions, adapting or transferring pretrained time-series models to new nodes in the graph, and testing anomaly detectors that leverage both temporal patterns and graph structure. Overall, ChronoGraph stands out by providing (i) multiple signals per service, (ii) an explicit, readable dependency graph, and (iii) real incident-aligned anomaly labels, together creating a richer and more realistic benchmark for researchers and students exploring forecasting in complex, interconnected systems.",
    "results": "ChronoGraph delivers a realistic, end-to-end dataset for studying forecasting in complex software systems. It takes real production microservices and treats each service as a node that reports several metrics (like CPU, memory, and network usage) over time. The connections between services are captured as a graph, so you can see which services depend on others. In addition, the dataset proudly includes expert-labeled incident windows, meaning researchers can test not only how well models predict future values but also how well they detect or handle actual outages. This combination—multivariate time series, an explicit dependency graph, and real incident labels—creates a much closer match to what happens in real environments than previous benchmarks.\n\nCompared to earlier work, ChronoGraph is unique because it blends three important ingredients in one place. Some older benchmarks offered time-series data but without an understandable graph of dependencies, while others focused on graphs or on anomaly labels but not both in a real-world, production setting. ChronoGraph fills the gap by providing a real, graph-structured forecast problem with incident-aligned anomalies. The baseline experiments in the paper test a range of approaches, including models that simply forecast per service, models that leverage the graph structure to share information across related services, and standard anomaly detectors. The results (in simple terms) suggest that using the dependency graph helps forecasting be more accurate and robust across services, and that pretrained time-series models and traditional anomaly detectors can play a useful role, especially when evaluated in the context of real incidents.\n\nThe practical impact is substantial. For engineers running large microservice systems, ChronoGraph offers a realistic testbed to develop smarter autoscaling, proactive resource planning, and quicker incident response. By explicitly modeling how services influence one another and by validating forecasts during outages, researchers and practitioners can build forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that are better suited to real-world failures and cascading effects. In short, ChronoGraph provides a real-world, structure-aware, incident-aware benchmark that can drive the next generation of reliable, scalable cloud systems.",
    "significance": "ChronoGraph matters today because it puts real-world complexity into a single, usable dataset. Modern software systems—think cloud apps, e-commerce platforms, or AI services like ChatGPT—are built from many microservices that each emit multiple metrics (CPU, memory, network, etc.) and depend on one another in a graph. Forecasting what will happen next isn’t just about predicting a single metric in isolation; you have to respect those dependencies and the fact that incidents (outages, slowdowns) can ripple through the system. ChronoGraph provides both the multivariate time series and the explicit dependency graph plus real incident labels, so researchers can study forecasting that “knows the structure” and can be evaluated for robustness during disruptions. This makes it a practical stepping stone from toy datasets to models that matter in production.\n\nIn the long run, ChronoGraph helps push AI research toward structure-aware forecasting and anomaly-aware evaluation. It encourages the development of models that blend graph neural networks with time-series tools, so information can flow along service dependencies as events unfold over time. It also supports robust evaluation by including real incident windows, letting researchers measure not just accuracy but how forecasts hold up under outages. This trajectory is crucial for scaling reliable AI systems, where many microservices must auto-scale, fail gracefully, and recover quickly without human intervention.\n\nSpecific applications and systems that benefit include cloud-monitoring and operations tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and Dynatrace, which already aim to forecast resource usage and detect anomalies. ChronoGraph’s ideas align with these workflows, helping engineers build smarter AIOps pipelines for capacity planning, fault detection, and incident response. For people using large AI services such as ChatGPT, the lasting impact is clear: better, structure-aware monitoring and proactive fault management across the many backend services that power these apps, leading to more reliable, scalable AI systems. ChronoGraph thus provides a realistic benchmark and design guidance that shapes how we build, evaluate, and operate complex AI-enabled software in the real world."

    "title": "Understanding Graph-Structured Time Series: The Heart of ChronoGraph",
    "content": "Imagine you’re watching a city’s power grid. A city has many power plants, substations, and transformers (these are like the nodes). Each place has meters that report several numbers over time—how much power is produced, how hot things are, how much current is flowing (these are the multiple signals, or multivariate time series). The wires and lines that connect plants to substations show how power flows from one place to another (these are the edges, the graph). If one plant goes offline or a line gets congested, it can ripple through the network and affect others. Graph-structured time series works in the same idea, but for software services: each service is a node with its own time-varying metrics, and the directed connections between services show how they depend on and affect each other.\n\nChronoGraph is a dataset built from real-world microservices in production. Each service (node) emits several signals, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic. The edges in the graph encode dependencies, like one service calling another or sending data down a workflow. The key tasks here are to forecast future values of these signals for every service and to provide expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels. In other words, ChronoGraph lets you practice predicting how each service’s performance will evolve while also judging how well you can detect real incidents that disrupt the system. This combination—time-varying data, an explicit dependency graph, and real anomaly labels—makes ChronoGraph a more realistic and useful benchmark than datasets that only have numbers over time without the network structure or real incidents.\n\nHow does it work, step by step? First, you collect time-stamped, multivariate metrics from every service: for example, service A’s CPU%, memory usage, and outgoing network traffic; service B’s similar signals; and so on. Second, you assemble a graph that shows which services depend on which (A feeds B, B calls C, etc.). Third, you train models that can read both the time history of each node and the graph structure, so information can flow along edges. Practically, if service B starts using more CPU and more network to talk to service C, a structure-aware model can let service A “know” about this pattern and adjust its forecast accordingly. Fourth, you forecast future signals for each node and, separately, examine the labeled anomaly windows to evaluate how well your model can flag incidents. Finally, you measure performance with forecasting accuracy and anomaly-detection metrics, sometimes under different disruption scenarios, to see how robust the system is.\n\nWhy is this important? Real microservice systems are not a collection of independent signals; they are a connected web where one service’s behavior influences others. A plain time-series model that ignores connections might miss cascading effects or misinterpret backlogs and retries. Incorporating the graph structure helps you capture these interactions, leading to better forecasts and more reliable anomaly detection—crucial for keeping services responsive and costs under control. ChronoGraph’s design also reflects real-world operation: you get multivariate signals, an readable dependency graph, and anomaly labels that align with actual incidents, making it a practical and realistic benchmark for researchers and engineers.\n\nPractical applications of graph-structured time series like ChronoGraph include: proactive resource management (auto-scaling and capacity planning based on forecasted load across services); faster incident detection and root-cause analysis (using anomaly labels together with structure-aware forecasts to pinpoint which dependency likely triggered an issue); improved reliability engineering (SRE) workflows and runbooks for distributed systems; and benchmarking new forecasting or anomaly-detection methods that specifically leverage graph structure. In short, this approach helps you understand and manage complex software systems more like a well-orchestrated network than a bunch of separate time-series lines."

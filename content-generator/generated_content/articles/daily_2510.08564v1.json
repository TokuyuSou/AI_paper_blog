    "background": "Large multimodal models are built to be generalists: they can understand text and images and perform a variety of tasks. But in practice, if you try to teach them a handful of new skills by fine-tuning the model on those tasks, they often lose some of what they could already do well. This “forgetting” is a big roadblock for real-world use: developers want to customize a model for a new job or user, but without breaking its existing abilities. The problem shows up across different model families and across many tasks, so it isn’t just a quirk of one particular system.\n\nAnother challenge is that this forgetting isn’t simply a hard switch that happens once and stays gone. The research finds that what looks like forgetting can partly rebound as training continues, suggesting the model’s behavior is shifting gradually. A simple way to notice this drift is to look at how the model assigns the next word or token—its output distribution changes in a measurable way—and this drift tends to move in tandem with performance drops on held-out tasks. Think of it like a student who, while practicing a new skill, gradually adjusts their overall approach and starts to forget some of their older strengths; the study uses an easy “counting bias” check to capture this mismatch between what the model is now predicting and what it used to predict.\n\nWhy this matters is clear: if we want AI systems that can be specialized for new contexts without losing their general usefulness, we need to understand why this drift and forgetting happen in the first place. This motivates work that aims to keep the model’s broad capabilities intact while still letting it acquire new abilities. By focusing on the underlying cause—the drift in how the model generates tokens when fine-tuned—researchers hope to guide future methods that make it easier to add skills safely, reliably, and efficiently.",
    "methodology": "Think of a large multimodal model (LMM) as a very well-read, multi-talented librarian that can talk, see images, and reason. The researchers wanted to teach this librarian a few new skills (five target tasks) without messing up the skills it already has (held-out benchmarks). They did this by fine-tuning the model step by step and watching how well it did on a set of eight other tasks that should stay stable. A surprising finding: after a narrow, task-specific fine-tuning stage, the old abilities could look like they forget a bit, but if you continue training, those old abilities often bounce back a bit. This suggested something about how the model’s internal language choices were shifting during training.\n\nTo understand why this forgetting happens, the authors looked at how the model’s output words shift during fine-tuning. Imagine the model’s next-word choices as a distribution over many possible tokens. If training pushes this distribution to favor certain tokens too strongly, the model’s overall style and general behavior can drift away from what it did before. They introduced a simple “counting-bias” probe that tracks this token distribution shift. This probe co-varies with the forgetting, meaning when the token choices drift, the held-out skills tend to falter too. In other words, the problem isn’t just about learning the new task; it’s about how the model’s word-choice bias shifts as it learns.\n\nGuided by this picture, they designed two straightforward, robust tuning tricks that let the model learn new skills strongly while keeping drift in check:\n- Update only the self-attention projection layers during fine-tuning. The self-attention part is where the model decides how different words (and modalities) relate to each other. By changing only these parts, the model can adapt its relational reasoning without disturbing the rest of its knowledge base.\n- Update only the MLP Gate&Up (the expansion/gated part of the feed-forward network) while freezing the Down projection. This focuses the learning on new, richer transformations while keeping the compression step from reshaping the overall output distribution too much.\n\nAcross multiple model families and tasks, these two recipes produced strong gains on the new skills while largely preserving the held-out benchmarks. In short, the key idea is to teach new things by carefully limiting where in the model you adjust parameters, and to use the observed token-distribution drift as a guide to minimize disruption. The authors also provide code to let others try the same approach.",
    "results": "This paper tackles a practical problem: how can we teach large multimodal models (models that handle text plus images or other inputs) new skills without wiping out the abilities they already have? The researchers tested this by fine-tuning models to acquire five new target skills, while also checking how well the models still do on eight held-out benchmarks (things they weren’t explicitly trained for). They looked across three different model families to see if the findings hold in different setups. A key takeaway is that when you fine-tune narrowly to teach a new skill, the model can seem to forget some of its general abilities. But interestingly, this forgetting can partly recover if you continue training, showing that the issue isn’t a one-way collapse—there’s some rebound as the model adjusts.\n\nTo understand why this forgetting happens, the authors looked at how the model’s output changes during fine-tuning. They found a measurable shift in the distribution of generated tokens, which they could detect with a simple counting-bias probe. This drift correlates with the observed forgetting on held-out tasks, providing a straightforward diagnostic signal: if the token distribution drifts too much, the model is more likely to lose its general capabilities. Using this insight, they propose two simple, robust tuning strategies that achieve strong gains on the new skills while keeping the general abilities intact.\n\nThe two recipes are easy to apply and are designed to minimize internal drift:\n- Update only the self-attention projection layers (the parts that help the model focus and weigh information).\n- Update only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection (a specific, smaller portion of the feed-forward path).\n\nAcross models and tasks, these choices deliver solid improvements on the new skills without significantly hurting held-out performance. In short, the work shows a practical, lightweight way to extend large multimodal models with new capabilities while preserving what they already do well. This is a meaningful step toward more reliable, reusable AI systems. The authors also share their code, making it easier for others to reproduce and apply these ideas. Code is available at the linked GitHub repository.",
    "significance": "This paper matters today because it tackles a practical and universal problem: how can we teach a large multimodal model (one that handles text and images) new skills without destroying the model’s existing abilities? In real systems, adding capabilities (like better image understanding or new tools) often comes with the risk of “forgetting” old skills. The authors show that what looks like forgetting on some tasks can bounce back if you give the model more training later, and they link this to a measurable shift in the model’s output distribution. They introduce a simple counting-bias probe to monitor this drift, which helps researchers diagnose why forgetting happens. Most importantly, they propose lean fine-tuning strategies that learn a lot while keeping the model’s general abilities stable, such as updating only the self-attention projection layers or only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. This is a practical recipe for making skills stick without wrecking performance elsewhere.\n\nIn terms of influence, the work fits into and helped shape the broader move toward parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in large models. Instead of retraining or modifying every parameter, it shows that careful, targeted updates can yield strong new capabilities while limiting drift in other tasks. That idea—learning new skills with small, modular updates—has become a core pattern in industry and research. It underpins how modern systems customize models for specific domains, users, or multimodal tasks without paying the huge cost of full-model retraining. You can see the same spirit in production workflows that use adapters, LoRA-style updates, or other selective-tuning techniques to extend capabilities of chat and vision-language systems with plug-in-like efficiency.\n\nLooking ahead, the lasting significance is how this work supports safe, scalable continual learning for AI assistants like ChatGPT and its multimodal variants. The notion of teaching new abilities while preserving general behavior is exactly what you want when deploying AI that people rely on daily: it should grow smarter without losing reliability. The paper’s guidance—targeted parameter updates, and diagnostic tools to track when updates drift the model—offers a concrete design principle for future systems: modular, efficient learning that preserves core competencies. As AI agents become more embedded in everyday tools, this approach helps make upgrades cheaper, safer, and more controllable. If you want to explore or reuse these ideas, the authors even share their code at the linked GitHub repository."

    "title": "Understanding Output token distribution drift: The Heart of How to Teach Large Multimodal Models New Skills",
    "content": "Think of teaching a large multimodal model like teaching a polyglot chef who already knows many cuisines. You want the chef to learn a new technique (a new skill) without losing the old recipes and flavors they already handle well. After you start teaching, you might notice that when the model talks about the new skill, it starts using a narrower, less varied set of words. In other words, its word choices shift in a way that makes its next-word predictions more predictable and less diverse. Researchers call this phenomenon “output token distribution drift.” It’s the model’s tendency to change which words it tends to choose when it speaks, as a side effect of fine-tuning for a new task.\n\nHere’s how it works step by step. A large language–multimodal model predicts the next token (a word or a piece of text) based on what it has seen and the weights inside the network. When you fine-tune the model to acquire a new skill, you adjust its weights. Those adjustments don’t just help the model perform the new task; they can also shift how the model uses language in general. If the shift is strong, the distribution over possible next tokens becomes different from its original shape. That drift can show up as the model getting better at the new skill but getting worse on held-out tasks it previously handled well. To measure this drift in a lightweight way, the authors introduce a counting-bias probe: a simple statistic that counts how often certain tokens (or token classes) appear in the model’s next-token predictions. This probe tracks a bias in the token distribution and, importantly, it moves in step with the observed forgetting on held-out tasks. When the model’s output becomes more biased toward a narrow set of tokens, the probe flags a larger drift, which tends to align with worse performance on old tasks.\n\nA concrete way to picture it: imagine the model starts to favor generic, very common words (like “the,” “is,” “and”) a bit more after you fine-tune for a new skill. The counting-bias probe would register more of these high-frequency tokens in the distribution. If you test the model on an unrelated, held-out task, you might see its accuracy dip; the drift metric from the probe would also rise. This shows a link between how the model’s token choices have shifted and how its broader abilities have changed. The key idea is not that drift is bad by itself, but that it helps explain why the model’s general performance can deteriorate when you tune it narrowly for a new objective.\n\nTo combat this drift while still learning the new skill, the paper proposes two simple tuning recipes that tend to work well across models and tasks. First, update only the self-attention projection layers. These layers control how the model attends to different parts of the input, so changing them keeps the overall token distribution more stable while still letting the model learn the new skill. Second, update only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. This constrains updates to parts of the feed-forward path, again limiting how the model’s vocabulary usage shifts. In practice, these approaches give strong gains on the target skill with much less disruption to held-out performance, meaning the model can learn new abilities without erasing its general capabilities.\n\nPractically, this concept matters because many real-world AI systems need to acquire new skills over time without losing their broad competence. For example, a multimodal assistant that learns new image-understanding tasks or new kinds of visual reasoning should still perform well on a wide range of everyday tasks. By monitoring the output token distribution with the counting-bias probe and employing the two conservative tuning strategies, engineers can guide the learning process to be both effective and robust. If you want to try this yourself, the paper authors provide code to reproduce their experiments, which can help you apply these ideas to your own models and datasets."

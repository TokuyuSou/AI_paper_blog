    "background": "Reasoning centers big questions in AI: how should a computer judge whether another model’s answers are good, especially when those answers show steps, logic, or math? Before this work, building automatic judges was hard and often limited to small, tidy tasks. Many teams relied on hand-crafted rules or pretty short datasets, which can miss the subtleties of real reasoning. Others tried trial-and-error training methods that imitate how a teacher learns to give feedback, but these methods needed enormous amounts of data and careful tuning. The result was judges that worked well on a few tasks but didn’t scale to the broad, reasoning-rich problems researchers care about.\n\nAnother problem was data: you can’t train a good judge on a tiny set of examples and expect it to handle many kinds of questions. Think of trying to grade every possible student essay with only a handful of prompts—some important kinds of reasoning would never show up. Previous work often focused on a single type of evaluation (like pairwise preferences or simple correctness checks) and didn’t cover the full spectrum of reasoning tasks or multiple domains (math, logic, explanations, etc.). That left evaluators clumsy, biased toward certain tasks, and unable to reliably gauge high-quality reasoning in new or more complex problems.\n\nAll of this matters because better evaluators are essential for making AI systems safer, more trustworthy, and more useful in real life. Without scalable, data-rich judges, researchers risk training models to optimize the wrong signals or to “game” the evaluator, leading to overconfident but flawed reasoning. A scalable, multi-task, reasoning-focused evaluator would help researchers train models more effectively, test them more fairly, and push AI toward genuine reasoning improvements across diverse domains. This motivates the search for large-scale, open, data-driven evaluators that can handle many kinds of reasoning tasks at once.",
    "methodology": "Here’s the core idea in simple terms. The authors ask: can we build a strong, general-purpose judge for reasoning tasks by feeding it lots of examples and letting it learn to critique answers, instead of wiring in fancy reward signals or RL tricks? Their answer is yes. They create a family of large automatically-trained evaluators, called FARE, trained on a huge, diverse data set focused on reasoning. The result is open‑source models that perform as well as or better than much larger, RL‑trained evaluators, and that can be used during both training and real‑time evaluation.\n\nWhat they did, step by step (conceptual, no math):\n- Data gathering across multiple tasks and domains: they put together about 2.5 million samples involving five types of evaluation tasks (such as deciding which answer is better, checking step-by-step reasoning, verifying answers with or without a reference, and giving a single rating). Think of this as collecting a big library of “correct or solid” reasoning examples and the kinds of critiques a judge would need to make.\n- Build large, general-purpose evaluators: they trained two sizes of models, 8 billion and 20 billion parameters, intended to be broad and reasoning-focused rather than specialized to one narrow task.\n- Simple supervised fine-tuning with iterative rejection sampling: instead of using reinforcement learning rewards, they use a straightforward fine-tuning loop where high-quality candidate judgments are kept (rejection sampling acts like a sieve) and used to teach the model to judge answers. The idea is to progressively teach the model what good reasoning looks like by repeatedly filtering for better judgments and retraining on them.\n- Evaluate across real-use scenarios: they test FARE as (a) an inference-time reranker that picks the best candidate solution, (b) a verifier during RL training to guide policy updates, and (c) a test-bed for evaluating reasoning-heavy tasks (like math problems). The model’s verdicts are shown to be strong across these roles.\n\nHow it works conceptually (the intuition behind the mechanism):\n- What the model learns to do: FARE learns to assess the quality of reasoning. It looks at the content, the steps taken, and whether explanations line up with the final answer (or whether a reference is needed and matches). The training data teaches it “what good reasoning and good explanations look like” across many kinds of problems.\n- Why rejection sampling helps: by progressively keeping only the best examples for fine-tuning, the model is guided away from low-quality judgments and toward more reliable evaluative standards. This yields a robust, general-purpose evaluator without needing complex reward signals.\n- The practical payoff: as an inference-time reranker, FARE-20B can nearly match an oracle that always knows the best answer, improving the quality of outputs in real time. As a verifier in RL pipelines, it provides stronger, more nuanced feedback than simple string checks, boosting downstream model performance. And as a starting point, initializing other tools (like FARE-Code) from FARE gives you a strong, continually fine-tuned evaluator that outperforms some larger but less targeted open models.\n\nTakeaway: the key innovation is showing that scaling up a broad, reasoning-focused evaluator with a straightforward, data-driven supervised fine-tuning loop—powered by a rejection-sampling process—can yield a powerful, open-source family of evaluators. These FARE models achieve strong performance across multiple evaluation styles and real-world tasks, offering a practical, transferable alternative to RL-based evaluators for reasoning-centric domains.",
    "results": "Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE) are like smart judges you can keep in a toolbox to automatically check how well AI systems reason and respond. The researchers pulled together a huge, carefully labeled collection of 2.5 million example problems and judgments across five kinds of evaluation tasks (for example, comparing two answers, checking step-by-step reasoning, and rating answers with or without reference solutions). They trained two families of judges with 8B and 20B parameters using a simple, data-centered method called rejection-sampling supervised fine-tuning. The punchline is that these big-but-open models become reliable, scalable evaluators without needing the heavy, RL-based tricks some previous work relied on.\n\nCompared with prior approaches, this work shifts the focus from using reinforcement learning to train evaluators to getting the data and training loop right. In the past, many strong evaluators came from very large, often proprietary models trained with RL, and open-source evaluators were often outperformed by those bigger, RL-tuned systems. FARE challenges that idea: the 8B version already competes with larger, RL-trained evaluators, and the 20B version sets a new standard for open-source evaluators, outperforming some much larger, specialized systems. That’s important because it shows you can get top-tier evaluation quality from openly available models by simply scaling up the right kind of data and a straightforward training recipe.\n\nThe practical impact shows up in real-world uses. When used as a reranker during inference, the 20B FARE model gets very close to the best possible choice on math problems, meaning it can pick stronger answers from several candidates almost as well as a perfect judge. When used as a verifier to guide RL training, FARE improves the quality of the resulting downstream models compared with simple, string-based checks. And for code-related tasks, starting from FARE and continuing to fine-tune can outperform a well-known open-source competitor by a substantial margin in evaluating test-case quality. In short, FARE demonstrates that large, capable, open evaluators—built with smart data scaling and a simple training loop—can reliably judge reasoning tasks, support better training of other models, and be practically useful across domains without needing massive RL-heavy systems.",
    "significance": "This paper matters today because it shows the power of building big, high-quality evaluation tools using data rather than chasing new training tricks. By collecting 2.5 million samples across five reasoning-focused tasks, the authors train a family of large, open-source evaluators (FARE) with a simple supervised fine-tuning loop. The key result is striking: these 8B–20B parameter evaluators can beat much larger, RL-trained systems on many tasks, and they do so while remaining accessible and reusable. In real-world use, FARE models serve as inference-time rerankers for math problems, verifiers to guide RL training, and code-evaluation helpers that even outperform some commercial baselines on test-case quality. This demonstrates that scalable, data-driven evaluators can substantially improve how we judge and steer AI outputs, not just how we generate them.\n\nIn the long run, the paper helps shift AI development toward scalable, reusable evaluation infrastructure that complements model training. The idea of “foundational” evaluators—large, open, multi-task systems that can be fine-tuned for different domains—creates a modular layer you can plug into many AI systems, from chat assistants to code assistants. This matters for systems people use every day, like ChatGPT or other conversational agents, because evaluation and alignment signals are what keep responses reliable, safe, and helpful. The work also accelerates the open-source ecosystem: it sets a new standard for open evaluators, demonstrates strong performance without bespoke RL training, and provides practical tools (e.g., FARE-Code) that others can build on. As AI systems increasingly rely on automatic evaluators to steer training and assess reasoning, data-scaled, reusable evaluators like FARE are likely to become a core component of next-generation models and their safety, reliability, and usefulness."

    "title": "Understanding Iterative Rejection Sampling: The Heart of Foundational Automatic Evaluators",
    "content": "Imagine you’re hiring a team of quality inspectors for a huge, multi-task factory. You have a big pile of candidate reports to judge (2.5 million in this work), covering different kinds of tasks and domains. You don’t want to train a single inspector who only knows one type of task, so you need a way to pick the best, most reliable examples to teach them from. Iterative rejection sampling is like a careful, rounds-based screening process: you repeatedly test candidates, throw out the weaker ones, and use what’s left to train better inspectors. This helps you grow a strong evaluator without needing endless manual labeling.\n\nHere’s how it works step by step in the context of training Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE). First, you start with a large pool of training data—in the paper’s case, 2.5 million samples spanning five tasks and multiple reasoning-focused domains. You also begin with a base finetuning approach (supervised fine-tuning, SFT) so the model has something reasonable to start from. In each training round, you assign to every candidate sample a quality score that reflects how good or useful that sample is for teaching the evaluator. This score can come from how well the current model’s judgments agree with human labels, how clear the reasoning is, or how hard the example is but still solvable.\n\nNext comes the rejection-sampling part. For every candidate sample, you compute an acceptance probability that increases with the quality score. You then flip a biased coin: keep the sample with that probability, or reject it. Because you bias toward higher-quality samples, the training data in the next round tends to be cleaner and more informative. But you don’t drop diversity entirely—there’s still randomness in acceptance, and you can enforce quotas so all tasks and domains remain represented. After you select a set of “good” samples, you retrain (or fine-tune) the evaluator on this refreshed dataset. Then you repeat the process: new quality scores are computed using the now-improved model, another round of rejection sampling happens, and the model gets updated again. Over several rounds, the data feeding the trainer becomes more and more aligned with what you actually want the evaluator to do.\n\nTo make this concrete, picture a task that involves multi-step reasoning (like verifying a chain of thought and its final answer). You might generate many candidate reasoning steps and final verdicts. A sample’s quality score could reflect how often the model’s verdict matches a trusted human label, whether the reasoning is coherent, and whether the final answer is correct. In the first round, you might accept a broad set of reasonably good samples. After training, the evaluator is better at spotting solid reasoning; in the next round, higher-quality samples are scarce but you still keep some diversity, so you accept fewer but more valuable examples. Repeating this process helps the evaluator become robust across tasks, domains, and various difficulty levels.\n\nWhy is iterative rejection sampling important? It gives you a scalable path to high-quality data without needing endlessly more human labeling or expensive annotation. By focusing training on better-aligned examples while preserving enough variety, you can train very large evaluators (like 8B or 20B parameters) that perform well across multiple tasks. In the paper’s results, this approach helps FARE-based evaluators rival or surpass more complex methods and serves effectively as trainers and verifiers in real-world settings—such as reranking outputs at inference time or guiding RL-based training loops. Practically, this means you can build dependable automatic evaluators for complex reasoning tasks, apply them to rank model outputs, verify reasoning steps, and improve downstream models’ performance in a data-efficient way.\n\nIn short, iterative rejection sampling is a practical, data-centered method to steadily improve a reasoning-focused evaluator by selectively keeping the best, most informative training examples across rounds. It combines simple probabilistic selection with smart data curation to scale up to large models and diverse tasks, making it a useful tool for any university student or practitioner aiming to build reliable automatic evaluators for complex AI systems."

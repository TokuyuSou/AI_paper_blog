    "background": "Before this work, there wasn’t a good, scalable way to test how well language models understand culture. Many existing benchmarks looked only at small, surface-level aspects (like certain phrases or trivia) and couldn’t capture the full richness of cultural knowledge. They were hard to expand to new cultures or languages, often relying on experts to manually label what counts as “cultural understanding,” which is slow, expensive, and prone to personal bias. In short, the tests were incomplete, inflexible, and biased, so we didn’t really know how well LLMs could navigate cultures beyond a few well-studied cases.\n\nWhy this matters is easier to see with a simple analogy: culture is like an iceberg. What you see on the surface (food, holidays, clothing) is just a small part; most of it lies hidden (values, beliefs, social norms). If you evaluate a model only on the visible bits, you miss whether the model truly understands deeper cultural meanings. Without a theory-driven, scalable framework, it’s tough to compare cultures or adapt tests to many languages. This matters because AI is being used by people from many backgrounds, and misreading cultural cues can lead to offense, mistrust, or poor decisions.\n\nSo the motivation behind CultureScope is to fix these gaps by providing a structured, theory-grounded way to measure cultural understanding across languages and cultures. The idea is to create a comprehensive, adaptable lens that can automatically build culture-specific knowledge and evaluation data, rather than relying on hand-crafted tests for each culture. This aims to give researchers and practitioners a clearer picture of where LLMs truly “get” culture, reveal gaps that multilingual data alone cannot fix, and help push toward more trustworthy, culturally aligned AI systems.",
    "methodology": "CultureScope is basically a new, theory-grounded blueprint for testing how well language models understand different cultures. The key innovation is to organize cultural knowledge with a lens inspired by the “cultural iceberg” idea: most culture is hidden below the surface, not just what you can see. They translate that idea into a 3-layer structure containing 140 dimensions, which serves as a blueprint to automatically build culture-specific knowledge bases and corresponding tests for any language or culture. This makes the evaluation scalable and adaptable, rather than relying on small, hand-picked tasks or expert annotations.\n\nHere’s how the approach works at a high level, step by step:\n- Start with the iceberg idea and turn it into a usable schema: three layers of cultural knowledge (surface-level, everyday norms, and deep underlying values), spread across 140 dimensions.\n- Automatically construct culture-specific knowledge bases: a tailored encyclopedia of facts, norms, practices, and typical scenarios for a given culture or language, derived from the 140 dimensions rather than assembled by hand.\n- Create evaluation datasets from that knowledge: design prompts and tasks that require a model to recognize, reason about, or apply that culture’s norms and values.\n- Run LLMs on these tasks and measure performance across cultures and languages, identifying where models understand or misunderstand cultural nuances.\n- Use the results to compare models and cultures, and to pinpoint gaps that need improvement, with the option to expand to new cultures by reusing the same schema.\n\nThe big takeaway from their experiments is that current large language models don’t have complete cultural competence. Even models trained on multilingual data don’t automatically become culturally savvy; simply adding more languages isn’t a guaranteed path to deeper cultural understanding. CultureScope makes this clear by providing a comprehensive, theory-informed evaluation framework that can reveal specific strengths and blind spots across cultures, rather than giving a generic, one-size-fits-all score.\n\nIn short, CultureScope offers a principled, scalable way to test and improve how LLMs handle cultural knowledge. It provides a way to build culture-specific knowledge bases and tests from a common theoretical foundation, enabling researchers and developers to benchmark and iteratively enhance cultural understanding across languages and communities. The work is open-source, inviting others to adopt the framework for new cultures and languages as AI tools become more embedded in diverse real-world settings.",
    "results": "CultureScope is a new, theory-guided framework for testing how well large language models (LLMs) understand culture. Old benchmarks were often narrow, hard to scale to many cultures, and relied on expert annotations. CultureScope tackles this by using the cultural iceberg idea: culture has visible parts (like language and customs) and deeper, less obvious beliefs and values. The authors turn that idea into a practical system with a dimensional schema of 3 layers and 140 dimensions. This lets them automatically build culture-specific knowledge bases and corresponding evaluation datasets for any language or culture, making cultural testing more scalable and consistent.\n\nThe results show that CultureScope can effectively evaluate cultural understanding in LLMs and that today’s models still struggle with many cultural nuances. Importantly, simply adding more multilingual data does not automatically improve cultural understanding. The framework helps reveal where models fall short—especially in deeper cultural assumptions—not just surface-level language capabilities. By automating the creation of culture-specific tests, it also reduces the amount of manual annotation and expert effort needed to study cultural competence across many cultures.\n\nPractically, this work promises safer, more culturally aware AI in real-world use. It provides researchers and developers with a scalable, theory-grounded way to compare models across cultures, identify gaps, and guide improvements. The approach supports fairer and more reliable deployment of LLMs in diverse communities. The authors also share their code and data openly, inviting others to reuse and extend CultureScope, with all materials available at https://github.com/HoganZinger/Culture.",
    "significance": "CultureScope matters today because AI systems like ChatGPT and other large language models are used by people from all over the world. Without careful cultural understanding, these models can give responses that feel off, disrespectful, or simply wrong in different cultural contexts. CultureScope gives researchers and engineers a scalable, theory-grounded way to test and improve cultural understanding. Its key idea is to use the cultural iceberg idea (surface culture vs. deeper beliefs) and organize culture into 3 layers and 140 dimensions. This creates automated knowledge bases and datasets for any language or culture, so you can study not just what a model knows on the surface, but its grasp of deeper norms and values. Importantly, it also shows that simply adding more languages to training isn’t enough—true cultural competence needs structured, theory-informed evaluation.\n\nLooking ahead, CultureScope has had (and will have) a lasting impact on how we evaluate and govern AI systems. It helps move the field from broad language capability toward genuinely culturally aware behavior, making it easier to audit models for bias, safety, and alignment with local norms. Because the work comes with open code and data, other researchers and industry teams can build on it, creating standardized evaluation pipelines, culture-aware safety checks, and localization workflows that work across many languages. In practice, this kind of framework supports responsible AI development by giving teams concrete tools to measure and improve how models reason about people from different backgrounds.\n\nIn terms of real-world applications, the ideas behind CultureScope feed into several areas: multilingual customer support bots that must handle regional cultural nuance, content moderation and recommendations that respect local norms, and localization pipelines that preserve meaning beyond direct translations. As modern AI systems become more capable and widely deployed (think ChatGPT, Claude, or Google/Gemini-like assistants), culture-aware evaluation becomes part of their routine quality checks. Companies can use CultureScope-style taxonomies to audit and fine-tune models for different regions, ensuring safer, more respectful, and more useful interactions for users worldwide."

    "title": "Understanding Cultural iceberg theory: The Heart of CultureScope",
    "content": "Imagine culture like an iceberg. What you see above the water—photo-worthy traditions, foods, holidays, clothing—are the tip of the iceberg. Most of culture, say people’s beliefs, values, and how they really think about time, authority, and relationships, stays hidden underwater. This is the core idea behind the cultural iceberg theory. The CultureScope work uses that idea to study how well large language models (LLMs) understand culture: you can’t judge them just by surface facts, you also need to probe the deeper, less obvious parts of culture that guide behavior and judgment.\n\nHere's how CultureScope applies the iceberg idea in a practical, step-by-step way. First, it treats culture as three layers, and it uses 140 specific dimensions to describe them. The top layer covers surface knowledge—things like common customs, holidays, and everyday phrases. The middle layer captures norms and etiquette—politeness styles, how direct people are in conversation, and what counts as appropriate behavior in social situations. The bottom layer digs into deep values and worldviews—beliefs about time, hierarchy, autonomy, and how groups relate to one another. In other words, you move from “what people do” to “how people think,” to “why people think that way.” Second, the approach automatically builds culture-specific knowledge bases and corresponding evaluation data for any language or culture. This means you can create targeted tests for, say, a given country or community without starting from scratch. Third, you test an LLM with these culture-grounded tasks to see where it really understands culture and where it only knows surface trivia. The paper reports that many existing models do not show comprehensive cultural competence, and simply adding more multilingual data doesn’t automatically fix that gap.\n\nWhy is this important? For one, it helps ensure that AI systems are trustworthy and culturally responsible when they engage with people from different backgrounds. If a model only knows surface facts but misses deep cultural norms, it can misread humor, misinterpret requests, or give replies that feel blunt or disrespectful in a given culture. By using the iceberg framework, researchers and developers can diagnose exactly which layer a model fails at—surface knowledge, everyday norms, or deep values—and then target improvements. It also helps avoid overgeneralizing or stereotyping; the 3-layer, 140-dimension scheme pushes you to consider nuanced categories rather than broad, simplistic labels. Practically, this approach supports real-world applications like culturally aware chatbots, better translation and localization that respect local communication styles, and robust benchmarks to evaluate AI fairness across cultures. Overall, CultureScope offers a scalable way to probe and improve cultural understanding in AI, beyond what a single surface-level test could reveal."

    "background": "Before this work, image editing with AI was divided into many little worlds. For mask-guided edits like filling in missing parts, extending a scene, removing an object, or adding text, researchers typically built separate tools or models tailored to each task, each trained on its own data and judged by its own rules. This meant a lot of labeled examples, separate training pipelines, and different goals for each task. Because the tasks looked so different, it was hard to share ideas across them, and progress in one area didn’t easily translate to another. It also made it costly and time-consuming to maintain and deploy these tools at once.\n\nAnother big problem was evaluation. “What makes a good edit?” can vary a lot from task to task, and even people disagree on preferences. Optimizing a model for one measurement might hurt performance on another. With many different goals and metrics, there wasn’t a single, consistent way to teach a model how to judge results across diverse edits. This fragmentation made it hard to build a single AI system that can learn human-like preferences across multiple tasks and still perform well.\n\nSo, researchers were motivated to find a more unified approach. They wanted a single, shared learning signal—a common “judge” or reward—that could guide a model to do many different edits under different goals, without needing separate supervised training for each task. A unified reward model would reduce labeling and training costs, help the system generalize to new edits, and offer consistent quality across tasks. In short, the goal was to move from a patchwork of task-specific tools to one flexible, efficient AI editor that understands what humans want across a range of edits.",
    "methodology": "OneReward is built around a single, universal judge for image-editing tasks. The key idea is to use one vision-language model as a generative reward—the “referee” that can decide which edit is better for a given task and evaluation criterion. This lets a mask-guided image editor be trained to perform many different edits (like filling a missing region, extending an image, removing an object, or rendering text) without needing a separate, task-specific training loop for each objective. In short, a single reward model guides learning across multiple tasks and metrics.\n\nHow it works, conceptually (step by step):\n- Start with Seedream 3.0 Fill as the base editor that can modify an image within a binary mask (the region you want to edit).\n- For a given task, generate several candidate edits conditioned on the image and the mask.\n- Let OneReward evaluate these candidates: it compares pairs of edits and says which one better satisfies the task’s goal (e.g., realism, consistency, or meeting the edit requirement). This comparison provides a reward signal.\n- Use reinforcement learning to update the base editor so that it tends to produce edits that OneReward rates highly across many tasks and criteria.\n- Because OneReward can assess different tasks with different goals, the same loop works for all of them, eliminating the need for task-specific supervised fine-tuning.\n\nAnalogy and significance:\n- Think of OneReward as a universal referee who understands many different games. Instead of building a separate judging system for each exercise, you have one experienced judge that can compare results across tasks and criteria. This makes training more efficient and helps the model generalize to new edit tasks and data distributions without rewriting or retraining for each new objective.\n\nWhat they achieved and where to find it:\n- The approach yields a mask-guided editor (Seedream 3.0 Fill) that, when trained with OneReward, outperforms several commercial and open-source tools across multiple edit tasks and evaluation metrics.\n- The authors provide code and models, and the project is available at the OneReward project page: https://one-reward.github.io",
    "results": "OneReward is a new, unified way to teach an image generator to do lots of different “edit” tasks using just a single reward system. Imagine you have a smart painter that can edit an image where you specify a rough area with a mask (the black-and-white shape you want to edit). OneReward uses one vision-language model as the judge to decide which edits are better for a given task and goal. The same reward model can guide the painter to do multiple tasks—like filling a missing region, extending the image, removing an object, or adding text—without needing separate helpers for each task. The authors also show a concrete system called Seedream 3.0 Fill that uses this idea: it starts from a pre-trained image generator and fine-tunes it end-to-end with multi-task reinforcement learning, avoiding task-by-task supervised fine-tuning.\n\nIn many earlier works, different editing tasks required different, task-specific training data and fine-tuning steps. That means more labeling, more training runs, and limited ability to generalize to new tasks. OneReward sidesteps this by using a single, powerful reward model to evaluate edits across tasks and criteria, so the core image generator learns to handle a variety of edits in one training process. The result is a more flexible and efficient setup: you don’t need separate training pipelines for each edit type, and you can adapt the same base model to many editing goals.\n\nPractically, this approach leads to a noticeable improvement in how well the system handles mask-guided edits, and it competes favorably with both commercial and open-source tools (like Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill Pro) across multiple ways of judging quality. For creators and developers, this means easier, faster, and more versatile image editing powered by a single, unified model. The authors also provide code and the Seedream 3.0 Fill model so others can build on this work more quickly.",
    "significance": "Why it matters today\nOneReward tackles a practical and hard problem: how to teach a single AI system to do many different mask-based image edits (fill, extend, remove objects, render text) without needing a separate, hand-tuned setup for each task. By using one vision-language model as the reward signal, the approach lets a single training objective guide multiple tasks at once. This fits a big trend in AI right now: moving from many task-specific tools to unified systems that can generalize across tasks with less manual fine-tuning. In short, it shows a scalable way to build flexible image editors that can adapt to different goals using one underlying model and one training signal.\n\nLong-term significance and influence\nThe core idea—multi-task reinforcement learning guided by a single, unified reward model—could shape how we build future AI tools that need to switch between many editing or generation goals without reconfiguring every task. It helps push toward general-purpose generative editors embedded in larger systems, rather than a patchwork of specialized modules. This line of work also resonates with how modern AI systems are trained to align with human preferences (think RLHF in large language models): a common, multimodal reward signal can steer a model’s behavior across different domains, not just text. Over time, we may see more editors and creative assistants that rely on the same core reward model to handle new tasks by simply presenting different prompts or masks, rather than requiring new fine-tuning.\n\nApplications and connections to familiar systems\nA concrete outcome from this work is Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained with multi-task RL on a pre-trained base model, meaning you get versatile editing capabilities without task-specific fine-tuning. Beyond academic results, this direction feeds into real-world creative tools: image editors that can be controlled via natural language or simple masks inside chat or design apps, and AI assistants that can perform image edits directly in a conversation. The approach echoes how ChatGPT and other modern AI systems combine multi-modal understanding with alignment signals: a single, powerful reward model can guide diverse tasks across modalities, enabling more capable and reliable mixed-initiative tools in everyday software. The project’s code and demos (one-reward.github.io) make it a tangible step toward those integrated, user-friendly AI assistants."

    "content": "Imagine you’re a movie editor with a magical, universal judge. You have lots of different tasks: fill in a missing part of a photo, extend the scene to cover more area, remove an unwanted object, or even add readable text into an image. Traditionally, each task might need its own specialized tutor to teach the editing model how to do well. OneReward works like a single, smart referee who can judge all these different tasks using one set of rules, so you don’t need a separate trainer for each task.\n\nSo, what is OneReward actually doing? It uses one pre-trained vision-language model (a type of AI that can understand images and language) as a “reward judge.” The idea is to have a base image-editing model (for example, Seedream 3.0 Fill) that can propose edits given an image and a mask that marks the area to edit. For training, the editor generates several candidate edits for a task (say, filling a hole in the wall). The single reward judge then compares these candidates and decides which one is better for the task and its evaluation criterion (e.g., realism, stylistic consistency, or how well the text is integrated). This winner/loser comparison provides a reward signal. The editor is then updated through reinforcement learning to produce better edits in the future, all guided by that one shared judge.\n\nHere’s how it works step by step, with a concrete example. Step 1: you pick a mask-guided editing task—image fill, image extend, object removal, or text rendering. Step 2: the base editor generates several possible edits conditioned on the original image and the mask. Step 3: the one reward model (the single VLM) looks at each candidate and judges which one best satisfies the task’s goal. Step 4: the judge’s comparison yields a reward for each candidate. Step 5: the editor updates its parameters to maximize the chance of producing higher-reward edits next time. Step 6: you repeat this across many tasks and images, sharing the same reward model so the system learns across all tasks rather than keeping separate tutors for each one. For example, a mask over a building window might be filled with a realistic glass area that matches the surrounding scene, or text might be added in a legible and aesthetically pleasing way that fits the image style.\n\nWhy is this approach important? Because it offers a unified, data-efficient way to train a single model to perform multiple, diverse editing tasks without task-specific supervised fine-tuning. Previously, you’d need separate training signals tailored to each task, which makes the system harder to scale and generalize to new edits. By using one reward model that can judge across tasks, OneReward helps the editor learn general editing principles—how to blend colors, textures, and lighting, or how to place text so it looks natural—across different scenarios. In the paper, this approach is demonstrated with Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generator trained via multi-task reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, removing the need for task-specific fine-tuning. The results show the unified edit model can outperform well-known tools and competitors across several metrics, highlighting both practicality and potential for real-world use.\n\nPractical applications are wide. You could use OneReward-based masking to automate and improve photo retouching, content-aware fill in image editing software, removal of unwanted elements in situ, or adding contextual text to images for design and labeling. Because the framework is designed to handle multiple tasks with the same reward signal, it’s easy to extend to new edit types or new evaluation goals without building a new trainer from scratch. In short, OneReward makes multi-task image editing more efficient, scalable, and accessible to university researchers and practitioners who want a strong, flexible tool for creative and practical image generation and editing."

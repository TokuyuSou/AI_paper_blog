    "background": "Imagine you’re teaching a student who not only writes essays but also creates accompanying pictures or diagrams. Now, what if you only ever tested the student on writing or only on drawing? You’d have no good sense of what the student can do when both tasks must be done together—how well the explanations and the visuals fit each other, or how they support a single, coherent message. That’s a good metaphor for what researchers faced in AI before this work: most benchmarks tested either text generation or image generation in isolation, not the joint ability to produce both in one go. Real-world uses—like making a tutorial that includes both step-by-step text and matching visuals—need models that reason across modalities at the same time, and the existing tests didn’t capture that.\n\nA bigger problem was how people judged these multimodal outputs. If you simply asked another AI to rate image quality or factual accuracy, you could miss subtle mismatches or the deeper reasoning needed to connect words with pictures. Human evaluation is thorough but expensive and slow, so it isn’t scalable for broad research. Without a solid, consistent way to measure performance across a wide range of real tasks, researchers couldn’t reliably tell which models truly understood both text and images, where they struggled, or how improvements in one area affected the other. This left a gap: we needed a standard set of challenges that truly tests joint multimodal ability, plus a fair, nuanced way to score responses so comparisons across models are meaningful.\n\nIn short, the motivation for this work was to fill a practical gap in AI evaluation. As models start to generate both images and text, we need a benchmark that (1) covers diverse, real-world tasks that require using both modalities together, and (2) provides a reliable, fine-grained way to judge performance beyond simple or biased checks. That way, researchers can track true progress, understand where multimodal reasoning breaks down, and push the field toward models that can think and communicate across images and words in a coordinated, trustworthy way.",
    "methodology": "UEval is like a specialized “open-book exam” for AI that can both draw (images) and write (text). The main idea is to push a single model to generate outputs in two modalities at once, and to measure how well it handles complex, real-world tasks that require coordinating what it creates with what it says. They built a benchmark of 1,000 expert-curated questions drawn from 8 real-world tasks, covering a wide range of reasoning and explanation styles—from step-by-step guides to textbook-style explanations. This makes UEval a challenging test bed for unified multimodal generation.\n\nHow they did it, step by step (conceptual overview):\n- Create questions that demand both image generation and text output.\n- For every question, supply a reference image and a reference text answer.\n- Feed these to a multimodal LLM to generate an initial rubric—a structured set of evaluation criteria describing what a good answer should look like (types of reasoning, alignment between image and text, completeness, style, etc.).\n- Have human experts review, refine, and validate these rubrics, ending up with a large pool of criteria (10,417 in total) that capture many subtle aspects of quality.\n- Use these rubrics to score model outputs in a scalable, fine-grained way, rather than relying on a single “overall score” from a judge. This rubric-based approach helps catch subtleties in multimodal outputs that simple judgments might miss.\n\nWhat this buys you and what they found:\n- This approach, rather than just using a general-purpose judge, provides a disciplined, multi-faceted assessment of how well a model can reason, generate, and align both images and text.\n- In experiments, state-of-the-art but proprietary models like GPT-5-Thinking score around 66.4/100 on UEval, while the best open-source model only reaches about 49.1. This shows the task is genuinely hard and that there’s still a big gap to close.\n- A key takeaway is that models with explicit reasoning capabilities tend to do better. Moreover, if you transfer a model’s reasoning traces (the step-by-step thinking) to a non-reasoning model, the gap narrows. This suggests that the ability to plan and explain one’s reasoning is especially valuable for complex multimodal tasks that require coordinated image and text output.\n\nIn short, UEval’s innovation is a carefully crafted, rubric-driven benchmark for unified multimodal generation, built by combining automated rubric generation with human validation. It provides a scalable, nuanced way to measure how well models can reason and produce coherent, aligned outputs across both images and text, and it reveals the importance of explicit reasoning in achieving stronger multimodal performance.",
    "results": "UEval is a new benchmark built to test models that can generate both pictures and text—call it a fair, real-world exam for “unified” AI systems. It uses 1,000 carefully chosen questions drawn from eight everyday tasks. Each question asks for an output that combines images and written content. To make scoring reliable, UEval starts with a computer-generated rubric (made by a multimodal model that looks at the reference image and answer) and then human experts refine and validate those rubrics. The result is a large, detailed set of scoring criteria that let researchers evaluate model output with many small, precise checks rather than a single overall score.\n\nWhat makes UEval different from previous methods is how it judges answers. Earlier work often relied on multimodal language models to give a quick rating on image quality or text accuracy, which can be noisy or biased. UEval, by contrast, uses a rubric-based system with real humans to ensure fairness and consistency. It also covers a wide range of reasoning tasks, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations, so it truly tests whether a model can think through problems that involve both vision and language. The findings show that models with built-in reasoning tend to perform better on these tasks, and even if you transfer a reasoning style from one model to another, the performance gap shrinks. That highlights a key takeaway: good reasoning is important for nuanced multimodal generation.\n\nIn practical terms, UEval gives researchers and developers a robust, scalable way to measure progress toward genuinely capable unified models. It helps identify exactly where models struggle—whether with the visual parts, the textual explanations, or the logical reasoning that ties them together—so future work can focus on those areas. The insight that reasoning traces can boost other models suggests a clear design direction: teaching models to think step-by-step or share reasoning patterns could be a powerful lever for improving multimodal generation. Overall, UEval advances both how we measure and how we build AI systems that can see, reason, and write all in one go, bringing closer the day when AI can handle complex multimodal tasks in real-world settings.",
    "significance": "Here’s why UEval matters today and its lasting significance for AI, in plain terms.\n\nFirst, UEval tackles a big, practical problem: how do we fairly judge AI systems that can both see (images) and write (text)? Evaluating such “unified” models is tricky because you have to care about many things at once—image quality, factual correctness, clear explanations, and step-by-step reasoning, all in one output. UEval solves part of this by using a rubric-based scoring system created by humans, with an initial pass from a multimodal model and then expert refinement. It results in thousands of detailed criteria (10,417 in total) and 1,000 carefully chosen questions drawn from real tasks. This makes evaluation more nuanced and scalable than simply asking a model to rate another model or using rough metrics. A key finding is that models with explicit reasoning steps tend to do better on these multimodal tasks, and that transferring reasoning traces from a “thinking” model to a non-thinking one can significantly close the gap. That points to a future where reasoning, not just perception, is central to strong multimodal AI.\n\nIn the long run, UEval helps set a standard for how we measure and improve unified multimodal AI. Its rubric-first, human-in-the-loop approach offers a blueprint for building fair, explainable benchmarks that can adapt as models get smarter. This matters because it guides how researchers train and compare systems, pushing architectures that explicitly separate or share reasoning with perception, and encouraging methods (like chain-of-thought or modular reasoning) that boost cross-modal understanding. Real-world applications include education tools that explain concepts with both pictures and text, design and content-generation assistants, accessibility aids that describe visuals in helpful ways, and robotics or automation systems that must reason about what they see. Today’s AI systems—such as multimodal features in ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Claude-like assistants that handle images—will benefit from these evaluation ideas, helping developers build safer, more capable tools and letting users trust not just what the AI outputs, but how it reasons to get there."

    "title": "Understanding Rubric-based evaluation: The Heart of UEval",
    "content": "Imagine you’re a teacher grading a student project that includes both a drawing and a short write-up. You don’t just give a single overall score—you use a detailed checklist: Did the drawing look correct? Does the description match what’s in the picture? Are the steps clear and logically ordered? Is safety taken into account? This checklist helps you be fair, transparent, and consistent, even if you’re grading many different projects. Rubric-based evaluation in UEval works the same way, but for computer models that can generate both images and text.\n\nHere’s how it works, step by step. First, a question is posed that requires the model to output both an image and some text. For each question, UEval provides reference images and an expected text answer to guide the evaluation. Next, a multimodal language model (MLLM) looks at those references and drafts an initial rubric—a list of specific evaluation criteria describing what a good answer should include. These criteria cover a wide range of aspects: accuracy and grounding in the image, the quality and relevance of the text, the logical flow of reasoning, how well the text and image align, clarity, completeness, and more. In UEval, this initial rubric can be quite long—tens of thousands of criteria across all questions (the project ends up with about 10,417 validated rubric criteria in total), enabling very fine-grained feedback rather than a single rough score.\n\nBut an automatically generated rubric isn’t enough on its own. Human experts carefully review, refine, and validate the rubric to ensure it’s fair, unambiguous, and truly useful for scoring real student-style outputs. They may adjust criteria, add missing points, or clarify how to apply the score to different kinds of answers. The result is a high-quality, well-structured rubric for each question, with clear scoring expectations. Then the model’s actual outputs (the image and the text) are scored against this rubric. The MLLM applies the rubric—checking each criterion and giving scores that reflect how well the answer satisfies them. Because there are many criteria, the final score can reflect a nuanced picture of where the model did well and where it fell short, rather than a single number that blends everything together.\n\nWhy is this approach important? Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is tricky. If you rely on a large language model to judge answers, the score can be biased by that judge’s own strengths, blind spots, or training data. A rubric-based system, especially with human validation, creates a transparent, auditable standard that can be shared and replicated. It helps researchers understand exactly what a model is good at or struggles with—whether it’s reasoning steps, alignment between image and text, or the clarity of explanations. The paper behind UEval shows that reasoning capabilities matter for these tasks, and having a fine-grained rubric makes it easier to see the impact of different model abilities on each specific criterion.\n\nIn practice, rubric-based evaluation has broad uses beyond this specific benchmark. It can power robust model evaluation workflows in research labs and industry, helping teams track progress on unified models that generate both visuals and explanations. It supports education tech by enabling automated, transparent feedback on multimodal student work; it aids content creation tools that must reason about both pictures and words; and it can improve safety and reliability checks by making it clear exactly which aspects of a model’s output meet or miss the rubric. In short, rubric-based evaluation provides a scalable, interpretable, and fair way to judge the quality of complex multimodal outputs, which is essential as models grow more capable in both seeing and describing the world."

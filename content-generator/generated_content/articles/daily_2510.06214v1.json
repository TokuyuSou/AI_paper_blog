    "background": "Many AI researchers want to teach big language models to solve complex tasks by using outside tools like search engines. These tasks often require many steps: the agent looks things up, reads results, makes a new query, and so on. But not all trials look the same. Some problems need lots of searches and careful reasoning across many steps, while others wrap up quickly with only a few searches. Because of this, the paths the agent can take are structurally different from one another. Traditional training methods use one global reference score to judge all trials, as if every trial were the same. That mismatch creates a problem: the learning signal is biased because it compares apples to oranges.\n\nThink of it like grading students who tackled very different kinds of questions. If you give everyone the same overall score, you might unfairly reward someone who finished many questions quickly and discount someone who spent extra time digging deep into a tough problem. In the AI setting, this is known as cross-stratum bias: actions in different kinds of trials are unfairly compared, so the model can’t learn which steps really helped in which kinds of tasks. This makes credit assignment noisy, slows down learning, and can make the agent less willing or able to explore smarter, multi-step search strategies.\n\nAll of this motivates the research: we need a way to acknowledge that trials come in different shapes and compare like with like. By separating trajectories into homogeneous groups and evaluating learning signals within each group, we can reduce the biased comparisons and give the agent a clearer, more stable guide for improvement. The goal is to enable LLM search agents to learn better across a range of tasks—especially those that require foraging through many search steps—without being misled by structural differences in the trials.",
    "methodology": "Here’s the core idea in simple terms. When LLMs use tools like search engines to solve problems, each solution path (trajectory) can look very different depending on how many searches were done, where those searches happened, and what results came back. If you judge all paths with one single learning “baseline,” you end up giving unfair credit or blame to paths that followed a very different structure. This is like comparing a short, easy homework task to a long, multi-step project and trying to grade them on the same scale.\n\nWhat the authors did, step by step:\n- They look at the structure of each trajectory and group them into homogeneous “strata” based on how the search process unfolded (e.g., how many searches, where searches occurred, whether the results helped early or late).\n- Within each stratum, they compute the learning signal (the advantage) only using peers from the same stratum. In other words, a path with two searches is evaluated against other two-search paths, not against paths with five searches.\n- They apply a normalization inside each stratum so the learning signal has a consistent scale and direction, reducing the risk that one stratum dominates the learning just because its numbers look bigger or smaller.\n- To stay robust in practice, they also blend this stratified, inside-stratum normalization with the traditional global (across-all-trajectories) estimator. This keeps the learning stable when data is limited or when strata are unevenly populated.\n\nWhat this achieves conceptually:\n- Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN) is like grading students by the same course topics rather than mixing grades from classes that cover different material. It removes cross-stratum bias—the “apples-to-oranges” comparison—so each trajectory is judged fairly against its peers.\n- By computing advantages locally, SAN makes the learning signal more accurate within each stratum (ideally unbiased and with stable variance). Then, by blending with a global signal, the method stays practical and stable across the whole training set.\n- The result is a cleaner, more reliable learning signal that guides the agent toward effective, multi-step search policies without being misled by structural differences in trajectories.\n\nIn experiments, Stratified GRPO with SAN consistently outperformed the standard GRPO approach, showing higher training rewards, greater stability, and better search strategies on a range of single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks. The main takeaway is that explicitly accounting for how the problem structure creates heterogeneous trajectories lets the agent learn more effectively, because it credits and tunes each path against the right peers rather than against a mixed pool of very different paths.",
    "results": "Think of an LLM-enabled search agent as a student who learns by trying different sequences of tool use (like web searches) to answer questions. In many cases, different trial runs have very different structures: some use a few searches, some use many; some decide their next step earlier, others later. If you train the agent with a single global learning signal (a single baseline) that compares all these very different trials against each other, you get “cross-stratum bias”—it’s like comparing apples to oranges. That makes it hard for the agent to properly credit the right steps and can slow down learning or push it toward less effective search patterns.\n\nStratified GRPO tackles this by splitting trials into homogeneous groups, or strata, based on their structure (how many searches, where they occur, etc.). Within each stratum, it computes advantages and updates the policy using only peers that are truly comparable. This careful, apples-to-apples comparison removes the cross-stratum bias. The authors also show a theoretical property: advantages estimated inside each stratum are unbiased and have stable variance, and when you keep the global normalization intact, you still maintain clean, scalable learning signals. To keep training stable when you have limited data, they blend these stratum-specific estimates with the global one, so you get the best of both worlds.\n\nPractically, this approach leads to meaningful improvements over the previous method that used a single global baseline (GRPO). The Stratified GRPO method learns smarter, more reliable search policies and achieves higher training rewards and more stable learning across both simple (single-hop) and more complex (multi-hop) QA tasks. In short, stratifying by trajectory structure provides a principled, effective way to handle the structural heterogeneity that naturally arises when LLMs use external tools, enabling faster learning and better performance with tool-using agents.",
    "significance": "This paper matters today because it tackles a really practical problem that many modern AI assistants face: when an agent learns by asking questions and calling tools (like search engines) to solve problems, not all learning traces are created equal. Some problem-solving traces involve many tool calls and long chains of reasoning, while others are short and straightforward. If you train with a single global baseline or a single “average” learning signal, you end up comparing apples to oranges. That cross-stratum bias makes credit assignment noisy and can mislead the agent about which strategies are actually good. Stratified GRPO (and its Stratified Advantage Normalization, SAN) solves this by sorting trajectories into homogeneous groups (strata) based on their structure, and then computing advantages inside each group. In plain terms: you compare each trajectory to its true peers, not to wildly different ones, which keeps the learning signal clean, stable, and more meaningful.\n\nIn the long run, this idea helps build more capable and reliable AI systems that reason with tools. The method gives a principled way to handle structural heterogeneity in reinforcement learning—exactly the kind of heterogeneity you get when agents perform multi-step searches, use different numbers of tools, or switch between solving subgoals. The paper shows that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields unbiased and stable learning signals inside each stratum, and still maintains the good properties of global normalization when blended. That combination—local, fair credit assignment with a safe global fallback—makes training more robust in finite data and in real-world settings where the agent must learn long, tool-using strategies. This is especially relevant for multi-hop question answering and other tasks where a correct answer often depends on several rounds of search and tool use.\n\nConnecting to today’s AI systems people actually use, this line of work helped push toward more structured, tool-aware RL for LLM agents. Modern chat assistants and plugins (think ChatGPT with browsing, code execution, or other plugins) rely on learning when and how to call tools to perform long, multi-step tasks. The stratified approach gives a principled way to train those policies so they don’t get confused by the different shapes of traces a user might experience—from quick, single-step lookups to long, multi-hop searches. In short, Stratified GRPO helps make tool-use in LLM agents more stable, scalable, and effective, laying groundwork for the next generation of dependable, multi-tool AI assistants that dominate everyday AI-powered workflows in education, research, and industry."

    "content": "Imagine you’re a recruiter who reviews two different kinds of candidate projects. Some candidates do a quick one-page task with little digging, while others do a longer, multi-step project with many checks. If you judge all candidates by the same overall score, you might unfairly reward or penalize those doing the short task just because the long task naturally has bigger numbers or different patterns. This is similar to what Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN) is trying to fix in reinforcement learning for LLM search agents: the agent’s “trajectories” (its sequences of actions and rewards) can come in very different shapes, depending on how many search calls it makes and where those calls happen. If you compare all trajectories using one global baseline, you end up mixing apples and oranges, which makes learning noisy and less effective.\n\nHere’s how SAN works in simple steps. First, you split all trajectories into homogeneous groups called strata, based on their structure—things like the number of search calls, where those calls occur, or whether the call results were successful. So, a trajectory with exactly one search call in a specific position goes into Stratum A, while a trajectory with three searches goes into Stratum B, and so on. Next, inside each stratum, you compute the usual idea from policy gradient learning: an advantage that measures how good each action was compared to a baseline. But crucially, this baseline and the “typical” value come from peers inside the same stratum, not from all trajectories together. Then you normalize these advantages within the stratum: you subtract the stratum’s mean advantage and divide by its standard deviation. The result is a z-score-like quantity that tells you how much better or worse an action was compared to other similar, structurally alike actions. Finally, you use these stratum-local, normalized advantages to guide the policy update, so the learning signal compares like with like.\n\nA concrete toy example helps visualize the idea. Suppose Stratum A (one search) has three trajectories with score-like returns of 10, 9, and 11. The stratum mean is 10, and the spread is about 1, so the advantages are roughly 0, -1, and +1. After normalization, these become 0, -1, and +1. Now Stratum B (three searches) might have returns 6, 4, and 5, with mean 5 and std about 1, giving raw advantages of +1, -1, and 0, which normalize to +1, -1, and 0. Notice how within each stratum, a “good” step is judged against its peers in the same kind of task, not against very different tasks. If you had used a single global baseline across all trajectories, the same numbers could be interpreted very differently because the distributions of returns differ across strata. SAN prevents that misinterpretation.\n\nWhy is this important? Stratified, locally normalized advantages give you a cleaner, more stable learning signal. They remove cross-stratum bias (the apples-to-oranges problem) and ensure you’re crediting the agent for good decisions relative to the right peers. Within each stratum, the estimates also have good statistical properties: conditionally unbiased and unit-variance, which helps the optimizer learn more predictably. At the same time, SAN preserves the desirable global properties of standard normalization, so the learning signal isn’t lost when you look at the big picture. To keep training robust in practical, finite-sample settings, SAN can be blended with the global, non-stratified estimator, giving you the best of both worlds: the precision of stratum-level comparisons and the stability of a global signal.\n\nIn practice, SAN is especially useful for LLM-based search agents, where your tasks naturally vary in how many external calls you make and where you place them in the reasoning process. It helps the agent learn more effective, multi-step search strategies by giving each strategy type its own fair evaluation. Beyond LLMs, any reinforcement learning problem with structural heterogeneity—like robots that must perform different numbers of subgoals, or planning systems that sometimes take short shortcuts and other times lengthy, stepwise paths—can benefit from stratified normalization. If you’re teaching a class or presenting to teammates, you can explain SAN as “grading each kind of task against its own peers, then combining the fair grades into one learning signal.” That makes it easier for beginners to understand why this approach helps the agent learn better and more reliably."

    "background": "Why this research was needed (in plain terms)\n\nBefore this work, talking with large language models (LLMs) on long, multi-turn chats often felt like you were driving a car with no clear map. You set a goal (like writing an essay or planning a project), but as the conversation wandered, it was easy to lose track of that goal. The model could drift to side topics, repeat itself, or misunderstand what you were trying to achieve, so you couldn’t easily tell whether you were making real progress.\n\nThat’s a big deal because in tasks like writing, planning, or brainstorming, you need to know where you stand and what to do next. Without a simple way to review progress, you end up juggling the goal, the chat history, and the model’s replies in your head—which is cognitively exhausting and prone to miscommunication. People may waste time exploring prompts or chasing responses that don’t actually move them toward their goal.\n\nIn the broader AI world, these conversations are becoming more common in education, work, and creativity. The motivation here is to reduce that confusion and cognitive load, so users can communicate their goals clearly, see how the dialogue is progressing, and adjust strategies when needed. By studying how to better track and review goals in a chat with an AI, researchers aim to make AI-assisted conversations more reliable, easier to use, and more helpful for students and other users who are new to AI.",
    "methodology": "OnGoal tackles a common problem in long chats with big language models: it’s easy to lose track of what you’re trying to achieve as the conversation goes on. The core idea is to explicitly track your conversational goals and give you feedback that helps you steer the dialogue toward those goals. Conceptually, the workflow looks like this:\n- Step 1: You state the goal(s) for the conversation (for example, “produce a clear outline for a writing task”).\n- Step 2: The interface watches the chat to see how well the current replies are helping reach those goals, like a navigator checking your route.\n- Step 3: The system uses the language model itself to evaluate whether the goals are being met in each turn and overall (LLM-assisted evaluation).\n- Step 4: It presents real-time feedback on alignment, plus concrete explanations and examples of why a turn did or didn’t advance the goals, and it also shows how goals have progressed over time with a simple overview or timeline.\n\nThe study behind OnGoal compared this goal-tracking interface to a baseline chat interface that didn’t track goals. Twenty participants took part in a writing task, using both interfaces in different conditions. The researchers looked at how long people spent, how much effort they felt they were putting in, and whether participants tried different ways of prompting the model to overcome miscommunication. The key findings were that with OnGoal, participants spent less time and effort to reach their goals, and they tended to explore new prompting strategies to steer the conversation more effectively. This suggests that tracking and visualizing goals can make dialogues with LLMs more engaging and resilient.\n\nIn terms of what this means and how it works conceptually, the main innovation is making goals explicit and continually mapped to the conversation in real time. Think of goals as bookmarks or milestones in a long conversation, with a GPS-like view of progress and a coach-like feed-back after each turn. The explanations and examples help users understand why a response did or didn’t help, and the time-based overview shows how the conversation evolved toward those goals. The design implications point toward interfaces that reduce cognitive load by clarifying goals, make progress easy to see, and encourage interactive strategies that improve the model’s behavior over time. While promising, the study is based on a specific task with a modest number of participants, so future work could test broader tasks and populations to further validate and refine these ideas.",
    "results": "OnGoal is a new chat interface for talking with large language models that also tracks your goals as you chat. Instead of just answering questions, it watches how the conversation lines up with what you want to achieve, gives you real-time feedback on goal alignment, and explains why the feedback makes sense with concrete examples. It also shows you a live picture of how your goals have progressed over time, so you can see whether you’re moving toward them or getting off track. This makes it easier to steer a long, multi-turn conversation in the right direction.\n\nCompared to typical chat tools, OnGoal adds explicit goal tracking and visualization. Most existing interfaces don’t tell you how well a dialogue is meeting your goals, which can leave you guessing if the conversation is really helping you accomplish something. In the study with 20 participants doing a writing task, users using OnGoal finished tasks more quickly and with less effort. They also tried new prompting strategies to handle miscommunications, suggesting that seeing goals and progress nudges people to experiment and stay resilient when the model isn’t perfect.\n\nThe work matters because it shows a practical way to make AI chat more reliable and easier to use in real tasks. The design ideas point to concrete improvements for future LLM interfaces: communicate goals clearly, reduce mental load by visualizing progress, boost interactivity with ongoing feedback, and use that feedback to help improve the model itself. For students and professionals, this means AI assistants could become better partners for long, goal-driven tasks like planning, drafting, or complex problem solving.",
    "significance": "OnGoal matters today because as chatbots and large language models handle longer, more complex conversations, users can lose track of what they’re trying to achieve. The paper introduces a practical way to keep goals in view during a chat: real-time evaluation of how well the conversation sticks to the goal, simple explanations for why the model’s judgments are correct or not, and a visual history of how goal progress changes over time. Think of it like a GPS for a multi-step journey in a chat. This helps people spend less time guessing whether they’re on track and more time exploring smarter ways to prompt the model or steer the dialogue toward helpful outcomes.\n\nIn the long run, OnGoal contributes a core design pattern for human–AI interaction: make goals explicit, monitor progress, and give clear, example-rich explanations for decisions. This pattern can reduce cognitive load, boost trust, and make complex tasks (like writing, brainstorming, or problem solving) more resilient when the model miscommunicates. It also points to ways to collect human feedback about goal drift and model behavior in a structured form, which can be used to improve future AI systems. In short, it helps researchers and developers build more transparent, controllable, and user-friendly AI that people can rely on for longer, tougher conversations.\n\nToday you can already see the influence of this idea in several areas. Prototype tools and research demos in education, writing assistants, and customer-support bots increasingly experiment with goal tracking, progress dashboards, and explanations of the model’s decisions. For systems people know, like ChatGPT, Claude, or Bard, the spirit of OnGoal shows up in efforts to make interactions more goal-aware, to offer progress summaries, and to explain why certain prompts lead to certain answers. The lasting impact is a shift toward designing AI chat interfaces that help users set clear aims, see how conversations evolve toward those aims, and adjust strategies quickly—improving effectiveness, learning, and trust in AI over time."

    "title": "Understanding Goal Tracking in Dialogue: The Heart of OnGoal",
    "content": "Imagine you’re planning a long road trip with many stops. You have a final destination (your writing goal), but along the way you need to hit several milestones (outline, thesis, evidence, conclusion). As you talk with a navigator (the chat with an LLM), you want to know not only how close you are to the destination but also whether each turn you take really moves you toward the goal. OnGoal works like that navigator: it tracks your conversational goal and shows you, in real time, whether the dialogue is staying on track, along with simple explanations and a visual view of progress over time.\n\nHere’s how it works, step by step, in plain terms. Step 1 is setting clear goals up front. You tell the system what you want to achieve in the conversation, such as “write a 900–1200 word essay with three strong points and two citations.” Step 2 is the ongoing tracking. As you chat, the system watches your messages and checks how closely each turn helps reach those goals. Step 3 is the real-time feedback. If your latest message or a model response aligns with a goal, you’ll see a quick note like “Good, this paragraph supports the thesis” with a small example snippet from the chat. If something is off, you’ll get a gentle warning like “This turn focuses on style rather than content,” along with a concrete suggestion. Step 4 is explanations with examples. The feedback isn’t just a verdict—it comes with short explanations and concrete examples from your own conversation so you know why something is considered aligned or misaligned. Step 5 is the goal progression view. A timeline or progress bar shows what parts of the goal you’ve completed (for instance, “thesis drafted,” “outline finished,” “three points listed”) and what remains.\n\nTo make this concrete, picture a writing task. Suppose your goal is to produce a well-structured essay about climate change, with an outline, a strong thesis, three supporting points, a conclusion, and at least two citations. In the first few turns, you’re asked to brainstorm ideas. The system might mark that you’ve completed the outline step as you draft a clear, testable thesis and list the three supporting points. If you then write a paragraph that introduces the thesis but doesn’t mention the three points yet, the feedback might say: “Aligned with goal: thesis presence; Not yet aligned with the three supporting points. Try adding two or three concrete points in this paragraph.” It can show a tiny excerpt from your text as an example to illustrate the alignment or misalignment. Over time, the progression view builds a simple history: Thesis drafted → Outline created → Three points elaborated → Conclusion drafted → Citations added. This lets you see where you are in the journey at a glance, without rereading the whole chat.\n\nWhy is goal tracking in dialogue important? Long, multi-turn chats can drift off course, so it’s easy to forget what you’re aiming for or to interpret a response as helpful when it isn’t. Goal tracking reduces cognitive load by organizing the conversation around concrete targets and by giving you timely, understandable feedback. It helps you experiment with new prompting strategies—if a turn doesn’t push you toward a subgoal, you can try asking for a direct outline, a thesis statement, or concrete evidence. The study behind OnGoal found that users spent less time and effort to reach their writing goals and learned new ways to prompt the model, suggesting that tracking and visualizing goals makes LLM conversations more efficient and resilient.\n\nThere are practical applications beyond writing tasks. Students can use goal tracking for brainstorming papers, preparing presentations, or solving complex problems step by step. Researchers can guide interviews or literature reviews by clearly marking subgoals and seeing how conversations progress toward them. In education and customer support, goal tracking helps both learners and agents stay focused, reduces back-and-forth misunderstanding, and provides a record of what was accomplished and what remains. Remember, the core idea is simple: define what you want to achieve, let the dialogue be monitored against those targets, see clear explanations and progress over time, and adjust your prompts or steps to keep moving toward your goal."
